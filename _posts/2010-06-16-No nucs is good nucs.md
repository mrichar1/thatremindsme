Today we inspected the 3 nucs we brought on at the start of the year, our aim being to expand as much as possible after our terrible losses over winter.The weakest nuc had a queen laying, but was in the process of superseduring. I have a feeling they're now drone laying, but we're giving them one more week to 'come right', or they'll be merged back into another nuc.  
  
  
  
The strongest nuc showed no signs of eggs, but the queen cells had been torn down, and they seemed to be acting as normal, so we're hoping the queen is mating as we speak. Again, they get a week.  
  
  
  
The 3rd nuc was very angry, with a lot of drones coming in and out. Again, we're hoping that the queen is recently hatched and out mating.  
  
  
  
So not much to report, other than its touch and go for all of them. However the hive they came from is strong, and we'll find out about the artificial swarm from that hive in a week's time as well.
