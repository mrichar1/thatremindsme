Went to the apiary today (the first dry and calm day in a long while) to give the bees a once-over.  
  
I was expecting them to have rampaged through their hives out of control, building brace comb everywhere and other annoying things, but they'd all been remarkably well behaved.  
  
Rebecca and Sarah are both doing well - with Rebecca slightly ahead (as a full split, rather than a brought-on nuc). Both have at least 6-8 frames worth of brood, stores etc, and are still bringing in lots of pollen and honey from the Himalayan Balsam which seems to want to keep flowering in the area. Both hives still had drones in abundance, meaning they're not settling down for Autumn just yet.  
  
I also took the opportunity to rehouse a nuc (one from another split from one of Cleo's descendants) into a full hive, with a view to moving them to a new site on the apiary. As is now my tradition, these bees will be named beginning with a 'T' - so **Tess!**
