Edinburgh University's [Doors Open Day](http://www.scieng.ed.ac.uk/Public_Engagement/Doors_Open_2008.asp "Doors Open Day" ) takes place at the end of September every year.This year we were involved in 'showing off' our bees to members of the public doing tours of the Ashworth Museum and other buildings at KB. We used a perspex observation hive, so that people could see the bees at work up close and get a feel for what goes on inside the hive. We saw over 350 people across the day, many with interesting questions, ad all with concerns over the future of bees - helped by the repeated highlighting of common issues in newspapers and the media. It was a very tiring day, but also very enjoyable, and hopefully we can be involved again next year, possibly even bigger and better!
