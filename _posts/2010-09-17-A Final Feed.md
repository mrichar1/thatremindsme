Its now officially getting a bit late to be feeding, but I thought I'd risk it since the weather's stayed good and the bees are still active and flying.  
  
I went to inspect the hives, and saw the following:  
  
Sarah has an undrawn frame on each side of the colony, despite feeding. However they'd started layering up brace comb with honey in it. Since they'll not draw and use this now in time for winter, they're finished with taking down food.  
  
Rebecca is full of very active bees, and had only half a side of a frame left empty on each side. As a result (and because the bees are very numerous/active) I've given them a good feeding.  
  
Tess is a weaker colony in terms of numbers, but they appear to have filled down the outside frames, so don't need any more feeding.  
  
I'll take the empty feeder off Rebecca next week, fit mouseguards and put on soaked sugar bags some time later in the year i case they need them.
