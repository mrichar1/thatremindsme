I spent some of Sunday afternoon soap-making - something to give people as presents. This time round I used a recipe for 'Honey and Beeswax Oat Scrub' - which turned out really nicely. The soap has a lot of beeswax and honey in it, as well as some oatmeal to roughen it for a good clean. This got me thinking this could be another direction for the hive products I end up with next year. Now I just have to wait 4 weeks for it to mature before its ready to try out!
