Finally a sunny day, and time to see what my recent machinations have resulted in.Alice seems to have hatched that supersedure cell, as there was a scattering of well-placed eggs in the middle of the brood frame. The colony is very weak and needs some feeding, but I can hopefully take them through winter - even just as a 'backup'  
  
  
  
Heather is still laying in perfect brood patterns, and is packed to the gunnels with bees and honey. However there are 2 uncapped queen cells with royal jelly and larvae in them - no idea if this is supersedure (ok), or swarming instincts (not ok), but I guess I just have to leave them 2 it!  
  
  
  
Poly is still doing well, with around 2 or 3 full capped super frames. Not enough to bother spinning off, but definitely worth cutting out for some eating with a spoon! At least they've drawn out all the other frames, so they should get off to a faster start next year.  
  
  
  
_Todo_  
  
  
  
Feed Alice soon. - DONE  
  
Check Heather in 10 days for signs of being post-swarm - DONE  
  
Take super off Poly when the weather turns bad -
