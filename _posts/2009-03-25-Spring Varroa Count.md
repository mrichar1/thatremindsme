title: Spring Varroa Count

Its very important to do a varroa count twice a year, in Spring and Autumn, to check varroa levels.We had a good look at all the trays from the apiary, which we put in 2 weeks ago, and we only saw 1 varroa on a tray from one of Faye's hives. While the counting by eye can be marginally inaccurate, this is still a good method.  
  
  
  
To calculate the varroa levels in the hive, take the number of mites found (be a pessimist, call it 3) and divide it by the number of days the insert was in (14) to give the **Daily Mite Drop** (0.22). If the count is higher than that given in the following table, action is necessary:  
  
  
  
Daily Mite Drop| Winter/Spring| 0.5 mites  
---|---  
May| 6 mites  
June| 10 mites  
July| 16 mites  
August| 33 mites  
Sept| 20 mites  
  
  
  
  
Luckily for us the count is well below 1, so no treatment is needed at present.
