A lovely couple of weeks of nice weather has really spurred things along!  
  
A short visit on Monday gave me an update on the state of things, and an opportunity to inspect the hives which are looking great after a new coat of linseed oil.  
  
The nucs left after splitting Yasmin have hatched, but no laying queens yet so I'll give them another week or 2.  
  
Yawning is coming on well and starting to work a super and build play cells, so another swarm might be on the cards!  
  
Finally Amelia is actually laying! 3 frames of capped brood means she's not lost after all. I might even get a chance to breed from her.  
  
Now to.just work on building all the new.frames and brood boxes for my expansion plans...
