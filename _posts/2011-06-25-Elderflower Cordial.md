The next tasty recipe based on elderflowers is cordial - there are literally hundreds of variations on this drink, but I have tweaked this one to suit my own tastes - not as sickly sweet, and without the lemon to let the elderflower flavour shine through. Feel free to play about with it!  
  
The easiest way to get the petals off the stalks is to place all the heads in a black bin bag, tie it 'inflated' with lots of air-space, and hang up for 24 hours. A vigorous shake (taking care not to split the bag!) and almost all the flowers will drop off the stalks, ready to be used.  
  
I make this recipe in large quantities so it sees me through to the elderflower season the next year - it also makes it easier when adding a campden tablet as I don't need to try to divide it up.  
  


### Ingredients

  
  
2 pints of Loose Elderflower Petals  
3kg Sugar  
3.5 litres Water  
1 Campden Tablet, crushed and dissolved in hot water  
50g Citric Acid  
  
Put the sugar and water in a pan and heat slowly, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved, trying to not let the liquid get too hot. Take off the heat and stir in the elder flowers. Cover and leave to stand for at least 12 hours to let the flavours infuse.  
  
Strain off the liquid, add the campden tablet and citric acid and bottle. With the campden tablet this mixture will keep indefinitely sealed, and should last for at least 4-6 weeks once opened if kept in the fridge.  
  
To serve, dilute 1 part cordial to 4 or 5 parts water - fizzy water, apple juice, white wine or cava/champagne all work extremely well with this syrup!  
  
You can also use the cordial as a sauce for desserts, whip it into cream to make gooseberry fool, or add it to meat dishes - anything where you want the flavour of elderflowers.
