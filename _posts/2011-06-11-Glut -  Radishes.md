Coming back to growing my own fruit and veg again, I'm reminded of the hassles of having a glut of certain crops at certain times of year. This post, and hopefully others following it, will be part of a series of recipes I've used to try and work my way round that glut... starting with Radishes!  
  


## Radish Top Soup 

  


### Ingredients

  
  
1 cup chopped Onions, Leeks or Spring Onions  
8 cups loosely packed radish leaves (tops from 20-30 radishes)  
2 cups chopped Potatoes  
6 cups Stock  
Salt &amp; Pepper  
2 tbsp chopped Fresh Mint  
2 tsp Sugar  
1/2 Cup Cream  
  
Fry the onions until cooked, add the radish leaves and cover, sweating for 5-10 minutes. Add the potatoes and stock and simmer for around 10 minutes until the potatoes are soft. Add the seasoning, sugar and mint and blend to a smooth texture. Add cream to serve.  
  


## Pickled Radishes

  
  
20-30 Radishes, Quartered  
2 cups (Cider) Vinegar  
2 cups Sugar  
2 tbsp Mustard Seeds  
1 tbsp Dill  
  
Heat all the ingredients apart from the radishes in a pan until the sugar has melted. Take off the heat and add the radishes. Pour into jars, and keep for at least 24 hours before eating. Store in the fridge.
