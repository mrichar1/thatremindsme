After dropping half a gallon of sugar syrup on my feet from the cracked feeder on Saturday, I thought I'd better top it up again.I added another gallon of 1:1 syrup to the feeder, and had a quick look at the frames - it looks like the bees are drawing out everywhere, including a bit in the super, which is a good sign. I'll be checking Wood for a laying queen on Friday, and Heather for eggs on Tuesday or Wednesday next week, so I can take off the feeder then.
