Just a few extra tasks completed today.I added a super to Poly, since they are filling out nicely. I also put a feeder on the nuc which the old queen from Wood is in, since I don't want her dying off before I have properly established a new queen in Wood. Will check in a week's time for signs of egg-laying in Wood, indicating presence of a new queen.
