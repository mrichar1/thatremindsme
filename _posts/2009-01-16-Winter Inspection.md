Today seemed the best day we've had so far this year, being above 6C for the first time and not raining, so I decided to go and have a mid-winter look at the hives.They're all still standing, which is a major plus! I had a quick peak in Wood, and saw the bees happily moving around, with no signs of hunger or a lack of supplies. I'll give them a hard sugar-bag feed some time later on this month.  
  
Poly was equally active - with bees even starting to fly when I took the cover-board off. They hadn't eaten all the hardened leftovers from the autumn feeds, and the top of most of their frames were still capped over, but given they didn't have a full stock of honey to start with, I gave them an extra sugar bag to be getting on with.
