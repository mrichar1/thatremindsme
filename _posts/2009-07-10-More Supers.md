Since the lime and Rosebay Willow Herb are both now coming out in force, some more supers were needed.A second super went on to Poly - she's only filled about a half of the current one, but better to get it on and them do nothing with it, than have them run out of space. Heather also needs one, but she's still got 2 empty brood frames at each side, so they're as well filling those before filling a super. With a bit of luck I might get some honey this year!   
  
  
  
I also discovered that a fellow beekeeper (who I went to help with a Pagden Swarm) has _black bees_ not far from us in Marchmont, so we'll hopefully have more genetic diversity to cross-breed with next season.
