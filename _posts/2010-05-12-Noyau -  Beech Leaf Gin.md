Its that time of year again in Scotland when the beech trees have unfolded their little bundles of leaves, and the light is shining through them - summer is definitely on the way!

At this time I always try to make a big batch of beech leaf gin, otherwise known as noyaux - a French word meaning a nut liqueur. Its easy and simple to make, tastes amazing and I always run out well before next summer - leaving me wishing I'd made more the year before!  
  
The recipe is incredibly simple:  
  


  

  * Pick a **bagful of beech leaves** (grab a thin branch and run your hands down it, stripping off the leaves). 
  

  * Put these leaves into a jar and cover with **gin** \- the more leaves, the more gin you'll need.
  

  * Place in a dark cupboard and leave for at least 2 weeks - the gin should go a yellow-green colour and take on a nutty scent.
  

  * When you can't wait any longer, strain off the gin, pressing the leaves to get the last of it out, then to every pint of gin add 1/4 lb of **sugar** or **honey**, dissolved in a little warm water or brandy.
  

  
  
The flavour is hard to describe - a sweet, nutty flavour, reminiscent of hazelnuts, or perhaps sake. Drink it slowly, as its very easy to quaff, and be aware that if taken in excess it does tend to leave you with a nasty hangover!
