Time to start the initial changes to get things going for winter.Poly have capped over around 4 frames in their super, so its probably time to take it off. I've put a clearer board underneath this, so the bees will leave it over the next 24 hours. Then I can run off with the honey! Its not enough to extract, but I can always try pressing it or doing cut comb. Just have to warn people about the wired foundation!  
  
  
  
Alice is looking very small, down to just one frame of capped brood and larvae, with little food left. I've migrated them into a nuc, and will be giving them a heavy feed tomorrow, once I get a feeder sorted out for that nuc box.  
  
  
  
Heather I'm leaving alone for another week, to make sure their requeening goes ok. However the high number of flying bees implies that the cells were indeed for supersedure, not swarming, so I'm less panicky about them now.  
  
  
  
I also saw Heather's guard bees kicking out drones, so they obviously know winter is here!
