The bees were delivered today!The bees had been transferred on smith frames into my cedar national hive from a nuc box at the apiary site in Currie a few days earlier, and were brought to the University site today. 4 smith frames in the centre, surrounded by 4 undrawn national frames, with 1 extra frame of honey (smith) on the outside.  
  
  
  
So far I haven't done much with them, but they seem quite aggressive, following quite a distance from the hive.
