With the work I'm doing making medieval shoes, I offered to draw up a bulk order for leather and tools for [Perfidious Albion](http://www.lothene.org/feudalist/perfidious.html). There are 2 main suppliers I use for leather things:  
  


  

  * [Le Prevo](http://www.leprevo.co.uk) \- These guys are friendly, helpful and will happily talk to you on the phone for an hour about the thing you want to make, what you'll need and what the best way to go about it is. They sell everything you could possibly want, at reasonable prices, though the delivery is often expensive, so make sure you order everything you might need in one go.
  

  * [Dickens Brothers](http://www.dickensbrothers.co.uk/) \- These guys are leather wholesalers, rather than a craft suppliers. They don't spend time on the phone discussing your project, or offering you tips, but they will sell you very good quality, extremely cheap leather. If you know exactly what you need, and are happy to do your ordering by phone and cheque or bank transfer, these guys are definitely worth looking at.
  

  
  
The orders are now all in - now to wait and see if I've forgotten anything!
