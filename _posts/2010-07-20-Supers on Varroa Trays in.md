Just a quick visit today to put supers on Rebecca and Sarah, and a varroa tray in Sarah. I'm not expecting a high varroa count at all, since this is a recent artificial swarm of a parent colony, but if it does show signs of varroa then we need to worry more about the others too. I'll be doing a count after around 7 days and using this [varroa table](http://www.woodwose.net/thatremindsme/2009/03/spring-varroa-count/) to check mite count.
