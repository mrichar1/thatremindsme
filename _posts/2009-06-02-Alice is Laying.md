Alice (daughter of Wood) has _finally_ decided to start laying.It looks like she started leaving almost the day after I left her alone, since there was capped brood, larvae and eggs in today. However, since they'd been left alone for so long, they'd ended up with honey and pollen right in the middle of the brood space, so I've rearranged the frames to give her more laying space in the centre. Hopefully this will mean that they won't make use of the numerous play cells that had popped up everywhere! I also added super, so that any more stores they bring in won't go in this new brood space.  
  
  
  
No sign of eggs in Heather yet, but she's only just into the mating period, so I'm happy to wait. Poly is also happily drawing out frames in the super, and the brood appears half drawn (4/5 frames drawn - didn't go in and check for brood).

Go and check for eggs in Heather next week (Monday, with Anne) - DONE
