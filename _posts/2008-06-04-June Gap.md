The June Gap is the time of year when there is a drop in available food and pollen between the end of the spring flowering plants, and the start of the summer-flowering ones.Since the bees had come from a nuc, the colony was relatively small, so hadn't had much time or workers to bring in nectar and pollen to keep up with the rate the queen was laying. Thus I decided to feed heavily over this week. The bees took down around 4 litres of 1:1 syrup (1kg sugar to 1litre water) in a week, showing they obviosuly needed the food. With hindsight, it would have been worth feeding the colony as soon as it was brought onto the site back at the start of May.
