Now it the start of April, and I'm off on holiday, I thought I better check everything was in order before I disappeared.The bees seem to be happy enough in both hives - the queens have obviously been laying well, with at least 2 frames of eggs, larvae and capped brood in each hive. Both hives have smith frames in them still (2 in Poly, and one in Wood), which need removing, but since they're currently being used for some egg-laying and as food stores its best to leave them til I get back. Each hive appeared to have approximately 2 brood frames, 4 stores frames, and 2-3 empty, but being drawn, frames.  
  
  
  
The Queen has now been marked in Poly - yellow, because we couldn't find the red pen :) She looked quite large and healthy so here's hoping she has a productive year!  
  
  
  
_Todo_  
  
Remove smith frames later in April, and return all the equipment to their rightful owners. DONE  
  
Move Wood's queen out into a nuc and bring on eggs from a 'calm' hive later in April. DONE.
