Wow - never though this would happen. Well, ok, it had already happened over here: [Bee Blog](http://www.woodwose.net/beeblog "Bee Blog" ) \- but thats was more introspection about bees on my part.  
  
I guess in a way its Bruce's fault, as he keeps pointing out things I say or do and follows them up with 'you should blog that!' So in the interests of writing something that no-one will ever read - onwards!
