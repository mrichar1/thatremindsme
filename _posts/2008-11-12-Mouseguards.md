Nipped up to the hives today, partly because its been very windy the last 2 days, but also to remember to fit a mouseguard to the Poly hive.I fitted one to the wood hive a month or so ago, to stop the wee beasties from getting in and trashing the hive over winter. However, I'd read at that point that you didn't need mouseguards on polystyrene hives, since they have a shallow entrance as standard. However, having now learned that mice can squeeze through gaps as small as 12mm, and seeing that the hive actually _came_ with a mouseguard, I thought I'd better fit it.  
  
  
  
No sign of any bees out today, although it was quite still and sunny. It must have been just too chilly for them to venture out (around 7C), although they did come onto the doorstep to have a look at what I was doing!
