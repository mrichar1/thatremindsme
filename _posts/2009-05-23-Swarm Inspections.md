Today was the final beginner's beekeeping class, and time to see how the 'swarm' Poly was getting along.As expected, there was a good number of bees working the hive - made up of all the flying bees from the original hive on the new site. However, they hadn't got much drawing done, so I decided to give them a feed to encourage drawing the new frames.  
  
  
  
1 gallon of 1:1 syrup was added, although closer to 0.5 gallons reached the bees, after I had to change feeders over having discovered a leak in one! This should give them some extra energy to draw out the new foundation, and allow them to create space for brood laying and honey storage more quickly.  
  
  
  
_Todo_  
  
  
  
On Wednesday, return and refill or take off the feeder. DONE  
  
On Friday 20th May check Wood for a laying queen and find and destroy her if she's still not laying, adding in eggs for a new queen. DONE  
  
Tues/Wed 2nd/3rd June check Heather to see if she's laying. DONE  
  
Varroa count in Heather and Wood.
