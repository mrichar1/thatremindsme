This last week has been fairly warm, with temperatures up to 7 or 8 C during the day.Its good to know that Faye reported seeing bees flying from my Poly hive today - obviously the warmth and sunshine brought them out. I'm not sure if there's much around for them at the moment (maybe some Ivy pollen?) but at least they'll be having clearing flights so the risks of dysentry and other diseases later on will be less.
