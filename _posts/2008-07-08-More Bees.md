My second colony arrived today - hereafter to be known as _Poly_ since I'm planning on housing them in a polystyrene hive.They arrived on-site in a smith hive, and were left in this in-situ for 24 hours to acclimatise to their new home. They were then transferred into the polystyrene hive on national frames, with some of the smith frames (carrying honey stores) coming with to give them a boost. They seem very quiet and not at all aggressive like my 'wood' colony.
