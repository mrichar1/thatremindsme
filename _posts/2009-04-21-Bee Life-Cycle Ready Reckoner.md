A while ago while struggling with the maths of working out the life cycle of bees, I decided to test my programming skills and create a 'reckoner' of the life cycle of the different bees.This tool is now freely available for you to use, and is kindly hosted by the Edinburgh Beekeepers' Association on their website in the [EMBA Downloads](http://www.edinburghbeekeepers.org.uk/downloads.html "" ) section.  
  
  
  
Please pass on any comments about this tool to me - it should hopefully be self-explanatory!  
  
**EDIT:** Now updated to version 4 thanks to comments from Mike Forster and others!
