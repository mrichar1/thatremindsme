I've given some thought to the new queens on their way, and decided that its time for them to have new names.I've decided on **Alice** for the new queen in Wood, and **Heather** for the queen in the new hive. Of course, I should really say _the next queen in_, since there's a chance these ones won't survive to mate properly, but fingers crossed!  
  
  
  
I decided its better to name on queen, than hive box, since things could become confusing if a box is named, but its occupants change with swarm control and bee movements.
