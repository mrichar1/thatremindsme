Went up to see the bees today, armed with a limited amount of 2:1 syrup (2 parts sugar to 1 boiling water). I decided to feed Rebecca because a) She's the most active, and thus most likely to take it down quickly and b) she's the easiest to get into :)  
  
The syrup had 3kg of sugar in it, so hopefully this will give them a good amount to feed on.
