Visiting the apiary today we discovered that one of our nuc boxes has been stolen!Whoever it was just took the one nuc, and left the rest of our hives alone. This implies that its a hobbyist just starting out, rather than a professional team looking for bees (who might have taken all the hives), but its still disheartening. What is more annoying is that this was an 'extra' hive we were bringing on for a fellow beekeeper who lost all of their bees over winter.  
  
  
  
However, in a reverse karma effect, we did have that artificial swarm shortly afterwards, so its not all doom and gloom :)
