Today was the first practical session of the Edinburgh and Midlothian Beekeepers Association Beginner's class, which was held at our apiary.Faye and I took the group of 9 (divided in 2) through my two hives - Poly is coming on exactly as expected, and just starting to draw out the first super I added.  
  
  
  
However, there were no signs of a queen in Wood. Its still a few days early to be conclusive that there is no queen present, but just to be on the safe side, I added a frame of eggs and larvae from Poly - if the newly hatched queen had gone astray, the bees will draw on this frame to create new queen cups and develop a new queen - if she's around, they'll just treat them as fresh bees. I marked the frame with a drawing pin, as its often hard to remember which frame to look at when you do these kinds of operations.  
  
  
  
_Todo_   
  
  
  
In a week go and check for signs of queen cells on this new marked frame, OR signs of a laying queen.
