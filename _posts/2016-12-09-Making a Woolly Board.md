Having just spent what felt like weeks waiting for a sweater to dry after blocking in a cold, damp house, I decided there must be a better way than drying them flat - especially when they need a bit of stretching in particular direction.

I subsequently discovered that you can get such a thing as a woolly board or sweater board - a kind of wooden frame to block a sweater on - however such things are expensive and hard to find!  So I set out to make my own, and thought I'd post some clear instructions, since the pictures and directions online are all a bit vague in places.

# Materials

* 6 rods (broom handles or equivalent will do): 90cm long, 25mm in diameter - for uprights and lower and upper arm bars.
* 9 dowelling pieces:  5cm long, 6mm diameter - to make dowel pegs.
* 1 dowelling piece:  90cm long, 6mm diameter  - to make the bottom bar to pin the sweater body cuff to.
*1 piece of scrap wood - at least 90cm long, and 3cm thick, of any width, to make a base/stand.
* 2 long (25cm or more) M6 bolts or threaded rods. (M8 will also do, but you'll need an 8mm drill bit too).
* 2 washers to fit thread.
* 2 nuts to fit thread.
* String

You will also need a drill with 6 and  7mm wood drill bits.

Notes:
- A 'dowel hole' is 6mm diameter, 25mm deep, unless otherwise specified.
- A 'rod hole' is 7mm diameter, all the way through the rod.


# Instructions

## Uprights

1. Take 2 of the 90cm rods, drill a 6mm diameter, 2.5cm deep hole into each end, and insert dowel pegs. These are to pin it to the upper arm and base.
2. Drill 10 7mm diameter holes through each upright, centred 2.5cm apart, starting 10cm from the bottom end of the upright. This is to fit the horizontal bar to pin the body cuff.
3. Rotate the rod 90 degrees, now drill 10 6mm diameter holes, starting 10cm from the top end of the upright. This is to tie the lower arm bars through.

## Upper Arm Bar

1. Take 2 of the 90cm rods, drill a 6mm diameter, 2.5cm deep hole into one end of each rod. Insert a dowel peg into one of the ends. This allows these rods to be pinned together.
2. On the side of each rod, starting at the 'join' end, drill 10 6mm diameter holes, centred 2.5cm apart, starting 10cm out from the join end. This is for the uprights to connect to.
3. Drill 2 or 3 7mm holes, 2.5cm apart close to the outer end of each bar, on the same side as the upright holes. This is to slot the tension bolt into.


## Base

1. Mark the centre point lengthwise on the bar.
2. Drill 10 6mm diameter holes on each side of this mark, starting 10cm out from the mark. These holes match those on the upper arm bar, for the bottom of the uprights to connect to.

## Lower Arm Bar

1. Take 2 of the 90cm rods, drill a 6mm diameter hole through one end of each. This is to thread the string to tie to the uprights.
2. At the other end, rotate the rod through 90 degrees, and drill a 6mm hole through the rod at around 35 to 40 degrees, starting at the end and angled back towards the join. This is for the tension bolts.

# Assembly

1. Thread the upper arm bars through the sleeves of your sweater, joining with the dowelling in the centre.

2. Insert the uprights into the body of the jumper, and pin to the upper arm bar at an appropriate point.
3. Push the bottom of the jumper up the uprights to expose the lower arm holes.
4. Insert the lower arm bars into the sleeves, and tie to the uprights at an appropriate point.

5. Pull the jumper body back down, pick up the frame by the uprights and pin to the holes on the base.
6. Insert the tension bolts into the lower arm bars, with a washer sitting on top of the bar, and a nut above (to stop the bar falling out).
7. Push the lower arm bars down to tension the sleeves. The washer should jam on the thread, stopping the bar from springing back up.

8. Thread the thin rod through the lower holes just below the body cuff, and pin or tie the cuff to the bar to achieve appropriate tension.
9. To release the lower arm bars, simply pull down on the bar and slide up the washer to release.
