Just a couple of examples of how English (though, I suspect lots of languages have this feature) can make repeated use of the same word while still remaining correct (though often not understandable.  
  
The commonest one is the repeated use of 'Buffalo' or 'Badger' - though both of these require some stretching of the language (and are contrived sentences to make this point).  
  
My favourite ones though, which could in theory be dropped into any sentence, are 'and' and 'had'.  
  
**and**  
  
John notices that a sign on a fish and chip shop has no spaces between any of the words, i.e. 'FishandChips'. He turns to his mate and says: _There should be a space between Fish and and and and and Chips._  
  
This one is of course easy to understand, especially when punctuated: _space between Fish and 'and' and 'and' and Chips._ ('and' in quotes being the and on the sign).  
  
**had**  
  
Jack and Jill are learning English and the use of the word had. _Jack, where Jill had had had had had had had had had had had the approval of the teacher._.  
  
Ok, so this one is a lot harder to understand (and drop into a day-to-day sentence!), but again can be understood by adding extra words and replacing a few hads here and there: _Jack, where Jill had written 'had', had written 'had had'; 'had had' received the approval of the teacher._ So, again quoting the written hads: 'Jack, where Jill had had 'had', had had 'had had'; 'had had' had had the approval of the teacher.  
  
Lovely!
