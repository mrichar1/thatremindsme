Time to feed the bees their Autumn sugar syrup.The weather has been really miserable in July and August, meaning that there hasn't been a summer flow harvested. So the feeding begins - 1:2 syrup (2kg sugar to 1litre water) from now until they stop taking it down and storing it. Given the lack of honey in both hives, there's going to be a lot of feeding going on!
