Its a little late now to be picking elderflowers, but there are still a handful growing in shadier places, so with that in mind I'm sharing my elderflower cordial recipe.  


  

  * 20 Elderflower Heads
  

  * 1.5 Litres Water
  

  * 1.2kg Sugar
  

  * 2 Lemons
  

  * Half a Campden Tablet
  

  
  
Bring the water and sugar to the boil, stirring well until a syrup is formed. Strip the flowers off the stems with a fork and place in a large bowl along with the lemon, finely sliced. Pour over the syrup, cover and leave for 24-48 hours for the flavours to infuse.  
  
Strain through fine muslin, add the crushed half campden tablet and place into clean bottles. Store in a dark place, and once opened keep in the fridge. To drink, mix one part syrup to 4 or 5 parts water (sparkling is good). It can also be used as a sauce for desserts, and even goes well with some savoury meats and cheeses!
