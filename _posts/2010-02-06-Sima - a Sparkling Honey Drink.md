I can't remember where I first got the recipe for this drink - but I do know it tastes fantastic!  
  
Its a traditional May-Day or spring time drink from Scandinavia, Finland in particular. In many ways its akin to Ginger Beer or Elderflower Champagne, but is made with honey and lemons, and it wonderfully refreshing.

**Sima**  


  

  * 4 litres Water
  

  * 500g Honey
  

  * 2 Lemons
  

  * 1/8 tsp dried Yeast (bread yeast is fine)
  

  * Handful of Raisins (optional)
  

  
  
Peel and slice the lemons into a bowl. Add the honey and 2 litres of boiling water and stir. Add the remaining 2 litres of cold water and the yeast. Loosely cover and leave for 48 hours.  
  
Put 1 tsp of sugar and 2 or 3 raisins into each of 4 1-litre PET bottles (the kind that are pressure-safe, such as those you get tonic water in). Add the honey liquid, and leave in a warm place. It is ready to drink when the raisins float to the surface (usually around 3-5 days).
