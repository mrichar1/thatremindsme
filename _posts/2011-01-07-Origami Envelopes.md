I'm a big fan of practical origami - especially for things that are useful in a day-to-day kinda way, rather than a 'this is awesome, but I'll forget it by next month as I never used it' design.  
  
To this end I have found 2 designs for envelopes that I use a lot - _why two?_ you might ask Well, one is folded from a square, the other from a rectangle - one is more of an envelope, while the other is more of a way of turning a letter_into_ an envelope.  
  
I'm always interested in hearing about new 'practical folds' such as these that you can use everyday - if you know of any good ones, please let me know!  
  


### Square Fold Envelope

  
  
This envelope is good for putting something else securely inside - be it a letter, beads, screws or any other knicknacks.  
  


  

  1. Take a square piece of paper, and fold it along a diagonal.

  2. Rotate the triangle so the long edge is down. Fold down the front flap only so the point meets the long edge.

  3. Fold in each corner point by about one third so that each point meets the opposite side fold, one over the other.

  4. Fold the upper corner point up to the centre line, and squash fold it down to form a square at the centre of the envelope.

  5. Fold the top flap over to the bottom edge, tucking its point into the square made by the squash fold above.

### Rectangle Fold Envelope

  
  
This envelope is good for folding a letter written on rectangular paper, sealing it (wax seal optional!) putting a stamp on the back and posting it.  
  
Note that the side facing you when you begin folding will become the **inside** of the envelope.  
  


  

  1. Fold a rectangular sheet vertically down and gently crease the centre line, then unfold

  2. Fold in the opposite corners so that the side edge meets the central crease, and the corners the mid-line at the edges.

  3. Fold in the side edges to meet the vertical edge of the previosuly made triangles.

  4. Fold the top and bottom points in to the mid-point on the opposite side, to meet each other at the centre line.

  5. Tuck these points into the small triangle flaps at each side of the middle line to seal.
