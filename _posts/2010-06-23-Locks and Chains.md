After having a nuc stolen at the start of the week it was time to bolt everything down to try and stop it happening again!  
  
We attached fastenings to one nuc, then gradually swapped nuc boxes with all the remaining nucs, adding a fastening to each box as we removed it from use. In doing so we got a chance to go through the nucs.  
  
The captured swarm from yesterday is packed to the gunnels, and will need a full hive box very soon.  
  
The strong nuc box is well-stocked with bees, and has one central frame covered in eggs (upright and leaning over) - which means that its taken that queen the best part of 3 weeks to start laying, from when we saw the attacked queen cells at the last beginner's inspection. It will probably also need rehousing in a hive in the next 2-3 weeks.  
  
The weaker nuc is less well-stocked, and had a small smattering of eggs, but enough to let us know that the queen is 'up and running.'  
  
Now to just wait and see if either of the split boxes decides to swarm again!
