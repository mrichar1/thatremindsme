Time to add the apistan varroa strips to help reduce the mite population in the hive.2 Strips are added to each hive - the strips are coated in a miticide, which transfers onto the bees as they walk across them. The strips will come out in 6-7 weeks, and hopefully the mite population will have been decimated. Of course, resistant mites aren't far away...
